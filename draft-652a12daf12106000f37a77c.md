## Overview of flow state

Imagine this: you sit down to program and the entire world melts away. Suddenly, all of your worries and fears vanish. The only thing that exists is your mind and the computer in front of you.

Any prior feelings of fatigue, hunger, thirst, and discomfort are no longer there.

Your eyes are locked onto the code editor with razor-sharp focus. Your fingers seem to be typing as fast as your thoughts.

You're effortlessly generating ingenious solutions and executing those solutions with such elegant code.

Anytime you run your code and get an error, you're able to debug with such grace as if the error is just some dust that you're wiping off with a microfiber cloth.

This is exactly what being in a flow state feels like.

In case you're unaware of what flow state is, it's a term from psychology that describes the feeling that people get when they're fully immersed in a challenging or creative activity. The activities that are associated with this state are individual to every person but are typically activities that a person is passionate about and skilled at.

### Effects of achieving flow state

Some of the common effects that people report when they enter a flow state include:

* Intense focus
    
    * It's very hard to get distracted while you're in a flow state
        
    * You might get a little irritated if someone tries to get your attention while you're in a flow state
        
* Reduced stress/anxiety
    
    * Being in a flow state can make you feel very calm without feeling sedated
        
    * A flow state can make you even more productive than a cup of coffee can but without any of the negative effects (jitters, anxiety, etc.)
        
* Increased self-esteem/confidence
    
    * When you're in a flow state, you feel like an absolute expert in the activity that you're engaging with
        
    * You have no self-doubt about your capabilities
        
* An intense feeling of joy
    
* Enhanced creativity and problem-solving skills
    

I've entered a flow state numerous times while programming or solving math problems in coursework and I experienced all of those effects that I described above.

Typically, a flow state for me can last anywhere from a couple of hours to the entire day. In the cases where I was in a flow state the entire day, I wouldn't even take breaks to eat or socialize (unless I was working alongside one or more people).

Although, on days where I was in a flow state the entire day, I'd sometimes take 15-30 minute walks to listen to music and get a little mid-day exercise in. Even during these walks, I would still feel all of those effects of being in a flow state and my mind would continue to conjure up solutions related to the activity that I was engaged with.

## Factors influencing flow state

The greatest thing about the flow state is that everyone can organically enter this state.

With that being said, certain factors at play influence whether you can successfully enter a flow state for the task that you're engaged in.

### Skill level

Perhaps one of the most important factors for entering a flow state is how skilled you are at that particular task/activity.

If you're a programmer, this doesn't mean you have to be on the same level as Guido van Rossum (the creator of Python). It just means that you should already have a solid foundation.

If you're just starting to learn how to program, for example, then it's much harder to enter into a flow state.

Alternatively, if you're past the learning curve and now able to build cohesive programs, then you might find it easier to enter a flow state.

I think it's worth noting that this doesn't necessarily mean that you can't feel generally focused and rewarded during the learning process. As long as you're passionate about software engineering, then the learning process won't feel dull.

It's just that you won't be able to reach that specific feeling of being in a flow state while you're still learning.

### Challenge level

The challenge level of the activity is a factor that goes hand-in-hand with your skill level associated with the activity.

If a task is too easy, then you'll just end up feeling bored and unsatisfied.

But if the task is super challenging, then it'll be much easier to enter a flow state.

Once you're able to combine your high skill level with a challenging task, you'll become unstoppable.

### Environment

The environment you're in while you're doing the activity is a highly individual factor for inducing a flow state.

What might work for someone else may not work for you.

I know that the perfect environment for me to enter a flow state is at nighttime at a coffee shop with a low level of distractions and surrounded by other busy people.

If you've never experienced a flow state, start by asking yourself where you are usually the most productive.

Think about the noise level, whether you're alone or around others, in public or private, the time of day, and even the weather. Obviously you can't control the weather, but if you find that you're more productive on rainy days, for example, maybe try simulating that by playing the sound of rain or getting a hot drink (if you do that on rainy days). If you notice that you're more productive when it's warm and sunny, then try doing the activity in a bright location.
