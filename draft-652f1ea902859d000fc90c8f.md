# Introduction

This article is part of a series called [Log Base Two](https://scrappedscript.com/series/log-base-two), a series dedicated to the relationship between math and computer science.

Just to give a bit of background on my experience in math, I've excelled in a total of 10 college courses in math:

1. **Single-variable differential calculus**
    
2. **Single-variable integral calculus**
    
3. **Multi-variable differential and integral calculus**
    
4. **Multi-variable differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions**
    
5. **Linear Algebra**
    
6. **Differential equations**
    
7. **Probability and statistics**
    
8. **Data analysis using R programming language**
    
9. **Multivariate statistics**
    
10. **Discrete math**
    

For a large majority of those 10 classes, I ended up with A's.

Although, before college, I struggled a lot with math in the classroom, even though math had always been my favorite subject since I was in elementary school. I found it hard to truly grasp the concepts taught because my high school teachers were too focused on skill assessment. Instead of focusing on the actual concept being taught, I was too worried about how I was going to pass the test the following week.

Once I got to college, I realized that your math grade (or any grade for that matter) truly doesn't define your potential. Further, I'd argue that your success in math *education* is heavily influenced by the quality of the teacher/professor's teaching.

My mission with this series is to show other people that math isn't so scary if you break down mathematical concepts into digestible bouts of information and investigate use cases of math in your primary field of interest (in this case, computer science). Along the way, I hope to also supplement your math education with quality content. I believe that **everyone** is capable of learning and truly loving mathematics.

**New articles in this series are posted every Thursday!**

## Overview of binary trees

In math, a binary tree is a type of graph that falls under the category of trees (as implied by the name).

Due to the simplistic structure and logic of binary trees, they've played an integral role as one of the foundational data structures used in computer science.

Like all data structures, trees are simply representations of a set of data points (aka nodes) that are connected via edges.

The best way to think of binary trees is to imagine a family ancestral tree (sort of).

In a family ancestral tree, you have a hierarchy of people defined by generation. At the very bottom are the youngest, and at the very top are the oldest.

Additionally, no one in the family ancestral tree is directly connected to any family member above the level right before them (their parents). Similarly, no one in the family ancestral tree is directly connected to any family member below the level right after them (their children).

Binary trees are structured similarly but not as complicated.

To start, binary trees begin with a single node (called the root node) at the highest level of the hierarchy.

Also, instead of having 2 parents, each node in a binary tree only has 1 parent.

Additionally, each node can have no more than 2 child nodes (simply referred to as the left and right child).

Finally, there are no "sibling" nodes in a binary tree. This means that each node can have at most 3 connections/edges: an edge connecting to the node's parent, and at most 2 edges connecting to 2 distinct children nodes.
