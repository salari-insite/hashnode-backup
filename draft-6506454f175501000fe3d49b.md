# Top 5 Reasons to Choose Shopify for Your Business

## [Long Trial Period](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624)

When it comes to running a business, every single choice you make carries a risk.

Shopify's trial period helps to reduce the risks associated with launching a new business, replatforming from another e-commerce platform to Shopify, and testing if e-commerce should be integrated into your business model.

When you [sign up for Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624), you get a free 3-day trial with no credit card required at sign up.

After your free 3-day trial, you can continue to run your business with Shopify for only $1/month for your first 3 months!

After your trial period is over, choose from an array of Shopify solutions starting at [$5/month](http://shopify.pxf.io/9gyqK4)!

## [Convert Your Instagram and Facebook Followers to Customers](http://shopify.pxf.io/XY2E7y)

Long gone are the days of social media just being a marketing channel for businesses.

Shopify has all the tools and support your business needs to [turn your social media accounts into sales channels](http://shopify.pxf.io/XY2E7y).

As a Shopify merchant, you'll have the ability to sync your product catalog and inventory with Facebook and Instagram, offer one-tap checkout, and access many customization features to help you boost your brand's marketability.

## [Access to Marketing Tools](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624)

Shopify offers a wide range of [marketing tools](http://shopify.pxf.io/anrDaY) to merchants.

With their automation tools to connect with customers, you get to save valuable time that would be spent on customer support.

Additionally, you can integrate sales data to segment your market and use powerful marketing techniques to target the right customers.

Lastly, you can customize your email and form templates to create meaningful relationships with your valued customers and promote new products and promotions.

## [Customize Your Website with Themes](http://shopify.pxf.io/nLWVYR)

Shopify offers a [large selection of free and paid themes](http://shopify.pxf.io/nLWVYR) that merchants can implement onto their Shopify website.

Shopify themes enable you to have complete control over your entire website's design.

Additionally, Shopify themes are automatically mobile-friendly, so there's no hassle with having to create a completely separate design for mobile users.

While there are no coding skills required to implement Shopify themes, you will need to edit code if there's a specific design or feature you want on your website that isn't offered with a current Shopify theme available.

Luckily, you have the option of contracting a Shopify Developer Partner, such as myself, to get the job done for you.
