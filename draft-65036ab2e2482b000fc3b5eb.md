# Introduction

**This article is part of a series called "**[**Bit by Bit**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/bit-by-bit)**", a series devoted to all-things programming. Whether you're still a computer science undergrad or the CTO of Apple, there's something for you here.**

**New articles in this series are posted every Tuesday. If you have any suggestions for a specific topic I should write about, please comment it down below!**

Without further ado, let's get to today's article.

# Version Control Systems

As the name implies, version control systems (VCS) are systems that allow for managing multiple versions of a file.

Using a VCS in software development is critical because it allows you to track progress made by you or others in a team, troubleshoot bugs introduced with software updates, recover corrupted files, and so much more.

## Local VCS

A local VCS works by storing all of the versions of a file on your local computer's hard drive.

This is a diagram showing the general workflow of a local VCS:

One of the earliest VCSs to ever be developed was a software called the *Revision Control System* (RCS). RCS included tools for creating local repositories in a working directory, "checking files in" to the repository, automatic assignment of a revision number for each check-in, "checking files out" from the repository, and setting file permissions across different users on the computer.

## Centralized VCS

To allow for sharing of projects across multiple computers, centralized VCSs were created. Centralized VCSs store all of the versions of a file in a database on a centralized server.

Here's a diagram showing the general workflow of a centralized VCS:

Centralized VCSs are still used to this day. One of the most popular centralized VCSs is Subversion. Subversion allows for the option of using Apache's server networking system or a standalone server, versioning of entire directories (unlike local VCSs such as RCS that only version files), enhanced capabilities for renaming versions, and interactive conflict resolution with Subversion's API.

## Distributed VCS

Distributed VCSs upped the ante by allowing users to download entire repositories to their local computer. As opposed to the centralized model where a repository exists on one server, the distributed model enables a repository and all of its history to exist on multiple computers.

This is a diagram showing the general workflow of a distributed VCS:

Distributed VCSs are the bread and butter of modern software development. Whether working individually, sharing projects academically, or working as part of a team for a large company, distributed VCSs have far more advantages and features compared to local and centralized VCSs.

As you might've imagined, Git is the most widely used distributed VCS. As such, it's proving more and more important to add Git to your arsenal of skills.

# Background of Git

Git's method of storing data revolves around the idea of storing repository data as snapshots of the files over time. Instead of storing data as individual changes to a file, Git encapsulates a snapshot of the entire filesystem each time a file is committed to the filesystem.

Additionally, Git's speed is what sets it apart from other VCSs. Since Git moves the entire repository to your computer, you can work on projects offline. This offline method of collaboration bypasses the need to constantly retrieve data from a centralized server over a network.

Git's workflow is broken down into three states:

* modified (the file has been edited but not included in your project's next commit)
    
* staged (the file has been added to your project's next commit)
    
* committed (file is stored in local database)
    

## CLI vs GUI

While there are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to use Git, the command line interface (CLI) for Git is the typical interface that's used.

With the CLI, you have access to all of Git's tools/commands, whereas GUIs are usually limited in the range of Git tools that they include.

Additionally, if you're collaborating with other people on a project, using the CLI for Git ensures that there are no differences in Git capabilities between you and anyone on your team.

With that being said, I know that the command line isn't everyone's favorite place to be on their computer, but there's only a small amount of commands necessary to be a Git "master".

Rest assured, I'll be covering the exact Git commands you'll need to get started further in this article.

## Git vs GitHub

Git and GitHub are sometimes confused for one or the other.

GitHub is an online platform that allows users to upload Git repositories to GitHub's cloud server. Additionally, GitHub does have a GUI for certain Git commands, but it isn't the best idea to use GitHub in this manner for reasons that I'll explain later on.

Nevertheless, GitHub is widely regarded for its large, online community of users (which reinforces the open-source nature of Git repositories), the ability to easily and safely share repositories with just a URL, and even the option for GitHub to host your front-end websites on their cloud server for free!

GitHub is a very powerful service that is almost always used alongside Git. For that reason, I'm going to be referencing GitHub throughout the rest of this article.

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, you can make one for free over at [github.com](https://github.com/).

As a side note, if you're currently a student, you can sign up for [GitHub's Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack#offers) for free which includes GitHub Pro while you're a student (a value of $4/month), a bunch of free online courses in software development, and a huge amount of third-party deals and promotions.
