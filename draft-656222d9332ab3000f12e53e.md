# Introduction

## Selling Art

If you have a creative mind and are skilled in an art form, then selling your art creations online is a great method to generate income for your work and turn your passion into a business!

Even though you can sell art on online marketplaces, starting an eCommerce site with a platform like Shopify will allow you to have your very own website for selling your art. Additionally, with Shopify, you can integrate all of those wonderful online marketplaces that you're already selling your art on. Shopify allows you to integrate sales data from multiple online marketplaces and platforms so you can track everything straight from your Shopify account.

This article is part of a series called [**Cache In Cash Out**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/cache-in-cash-out), a series where I help educate and inform established businesses, aspiring entrepreneurs, and independent developers about Shopify.

Shopify powers millions of businesses and is trusted by brands such as Unilever, Kylie Cosmetics, Allbirds, and many more.

As someone who values freedom through entrepreneurship, I love how [**Shopify's Mission**](http://shopify.pxf.io/5g1zrD) is to reduce the barriers to becoming a business owner by providing a platform that makes it easier to launch and grow a business.

No matter where you are on your journey, Shopify fosters a culture that empowers individuals who are seeking independence in the form of starting their own business.
