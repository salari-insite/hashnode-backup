## Overview of single-page checkout

As the name implies, single-page checkout consolidates the entire checkout process into one page, making it easier and faster for customers to complete their purchases.

All of the essential form fields of an online transaction are preserved in a single-page checkout including billing and shipping information, payment information, and order summaries.

In principle, single-page checkout promotes improved user experience, an overall simpler and faster checkout process, and reduced rates of cart abandonment.

## Advantages of single-page checkout

### Reduced cart abandonment

Single-page checkout decreases the cart abandonment rate for 2 main reasons.

First, by making the checkout process simpler, customers are less likely to become frustrated and leave your site in the middle of a transaction. With multi-page checkout, customers may feel like the process takes too much time and effort to make a purchase. Additionally, users may become frustrated if they have to go back to an earlier page in the checkout process to change a detail in one of the form fields.

The second reason that single-page checkout reduces the cart abandonment rate is that you're making the checkout process faster and more streamlined. If customers spend more time at the checkout process, they may second-guess making the purchase and become indecisive.

### Improved user experience

There are 2 main factors at play for why single-page checkout improves the user experience during the checkout process.

Since only that one page has to load for the customer to finalize the purchase, there's less concern about page load speed. In multi-page checkout, there are more opportunities for a page to load slowly during the process, damaging the overall user experience. Users don't like waiting long for pages to load!

The other factor at play is that you're making the checkout form easier to edit and review for the customer. Sometimes we make mistakes filling out online order forms as customers, and it can be annoying to have to go back to an earlier page to make a simple edit to some detail in a form field. With single-page checkout, customers can quickly review the information entered and rapidly make any necessary changes.

### Lowered complexity

Single-page checkout not only reduces complexity for customers but also reduces complexity for the business.

Think about it like this: when a customer adds an item to their cart, they already consciously make the choice that they *want* the product or service. This means that they want nothing else in the world than to simply be able to purchase that product or service with no unnecessary and complex obstacles. By making the online transaction seem like this complicated side quest with multiple pages, the customer might feel like they have to put too much effort into navigating the checkout process.

For the business, single-page checkout simplifies the development process. The business doesn't have to spend as much time and money on designing, developing, and managing multiple checkout pages.

## Measuring the impact of single-page checkout

As with any change made within a business, you should carefully monitor key performance indicators to gauge the difference that single-page checkout has on your business, and see if there are any adjustments you need to make.

### Conversion rate

Most obviously, track your business's conversion rate and see if single-page checkout has been boosting sales and revenue.

Conversion rate is the simple calculation that divides the number of orders on your website by the number of visitors to your website.

For instance, if your website had 1,000 visitors and 20 orders last month, then the conversion rate for your website is 2%.

If the conversion rate stays the same or decreases after implementing single-page checkout, then try looking at other indicators to see if there are other factors to blame for why your conversion rate hasn't gone up.

For example, if you see a spike in monthly website visitors but the same amount of monthly orders, then your conversion rate will decrease. One reason for a spike in website visitors but the same amount of orders is that you started a new marketing campaign that's mistakenly bringing the wrong audience to your website, thus no increase in orders.

Although, let's say that you see the same amount of website visitors but fewer orders after implementing single-page checkout, then carefully review/test the design and functionality of your checkout page. Make sure there are no bugs and the checkout page is properly made with UX design principles in place.
