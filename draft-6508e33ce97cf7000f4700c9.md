# Importance of choosing your first programming language

If you've chosen to enroll in a university, then the first programming language you learn is dependent upon the language that's used in your university's Intro to Programming course.

But if you've made the courageous decision to take the self-taught route of learning software development, then you have to make that nerve-wracking decision of which programming language you'll learn first.

But I'd argue that the first programming language you learn doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things.

What's most important in learning software development is not which languages you can code in or how you can memorize a language's syntax.

No matter which type of development you decide to do, the core of all software development is the ability to solve problems using logic.

Based on my own journey, I know firsthand that the first language that one learns means almost nothing.

The first programming language I learned was RobotC in a class I took on cognitive robotics, a required course for my B.A. in psychology.

RobotC is a high-level programming language based on the C programming language and is almost exclusively used for robotics programming in educational settings.

So basically, it's a language that I'll probably never use again.

However, this course taught me how to *think* like a software engineer and stimulated my interest in computer science.

Moral of the story? All that matters in learning your first language is that you learn the core of what software engineering is all about.

# Factors to consider when selecting a programming language

I know I just said that the programming language you learn first doesn't matter, but there's also no issue with wanting to start with learning a language geared toward the overall path that you want to take.

With that being said, here are some factors that you could consider when choosing your first programming language.

## Personal interests

The most important factor in choosing your first programming language is considering who you are as an individual.

Forget about all the external pressure of choosing the most in-demand language.

What matters is choosing something for yourself so you stay motivated to continue growing in software engineering.

## Personal Goals

The second factor you should consider is what you ultimately want to create with software engineering.

While some programming languages can be used in pretty much every type of development, some languages can only be used in **one** type of development (such as my first language, RobotC).

For this reason, if you want to increase the chances of learning a language that you'll use for the rest of your journey, then it's important to think about what exactly you want to build.

## Community support

You are far more likely to stay motivated if you learn with others than if you learn alone.

Additionally, choosing a language that is "popular" will increase the likelihood that you can find an opportunity to collaborate on a project with a team, or contribute to an open-source project.

## Ease of learning

Some people may tell you to first learn a language like Java or C++ so that you understand how computers compile code into machine instructions.

However, *compiled* languages can be very difficult to learn as a first language.

Software engineering takes a lot of grit as it is, so it's best to start with an *interpreted* language to get the fundamentals down.

## Versatility

If you don't have a set goal in mind with software engineering, then this point is especially important.

Choosing a versatile language will allow you to maximize the variety of types of projects that you can create while learning your first language, as well as enable you to test different types of development to see what you like best.

## Job market and industry trends

I'd argue that this factor should hold the least weight in choosing your first language to learn.

There are always trendy languages and libraries coming and going. While these trendy languages have a strong moment, a lot of them eventually fade away.

You should start with learning one of the core languages that have stood strong for decades, as these languages are probably not going anywhere anytime soon.

Additionally, the job market's demand for developers with a background in a specific language is always changing.
