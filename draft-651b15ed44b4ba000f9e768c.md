## I. What is error handling?

Error handling is a systematic approach in programming that includes the anticipation, identification, and resolution of potential errors that may occur during the execution of a program.

On the most basic level, to effectively manage errors, programmers use methods such as including the use of error-handler blocks of code and the raising of exceptions in a program's code. This methodology not only prevents the program from crashing but also allows programmers to give some type of useful response in the form of an error message to the user.

### a) Importance of error handling in software development

Incorporating error handling in software development is extremely valuable due to its capacity to facilitate a smooth user experience, support programmers in debugging code, and promote the engineering of robust and dependable software applications.

## II. Overview of exceptions in Python

In Python, error handling involves utilizing try-except blocks to capture one or more exceptions or errors within a specific code segment in a program.

In order to catch an exception, you as the programmer have to specify which exception(s) to catch.

If you've already spent some time programming, you might've noticed that Python has a long list of predefined errors, including SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, KeyError, AttributeError, and much more.

But what are these errors and where did they even come from?

As it turns out, just like everything else in Python, these predefined errors are just objects/classes.

![Python idle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1696543636803/e7d9d66a-043c-4e56-84b4-ac88dd2ef411.png align="center")

With this in mind, let's take a quick analysis of what makes up these predefined exceptions in Python.

First, if you use Python's `dir` method, you can see all of the methods and parameters that are defined for `SyntaxError`.

![Python idle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1696543780449/9d21a2d7-8db9-4a1d-91e7-c161ca023cbf.png align="center")

All of these methods and parameters work together to be able to reliably tell a programmer when they have a syntax error in their code.

As you can see below, when Python detects a syntax error, it automatically prints a message to the programmer: "SyntaxError: invalid syntax".

### b) Defining custom exceptions in Python

While it's cool and all that the engineers behind Python are nice enough to include these predefined exceptions in Python's native software, what if there's a very specific error that could be encountered in your program and Python's long list of predefined exceptions doesn't automatically detect this particular error?

Well lucky for you, you can define your very own exceptions tailored to your program :D

Before you start coding away on defining an exception class, let's see if maybe all of these predefined exceptions in Python come from somewhere else (in other words, if they have a "superclass").

![Python idle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1696544663218/d56270d5-3600-4a3e-8140-35e36c657e17.png align="center")

Sure enough, all of the predefined exceptions in Python inherit a base class structure from another class.

If you notice, KeyError's direct superclass is LookupError (which is just another type of exception), and LookupError's direct superclass is Exception. I included this example on purpose to show you that all of the predefined exceptions in Python ultimately inherit their base class structure from the Exception object/class.

With this in mind, we can use the same idea to quickly and conveniently define our own exceptions by inheriting the base structure from Python's Exception class and then adding in whatever custom functionality or attributes we want our specific exception to have.

```python
# Define custom exception's class and inherit
# attributes and methods from Exception class

class CustomError(Exception):
    # The pass keyword is just here as a placeholder
    pass
```

With the above code, keep in mind that the only "necessary" components are that you use the `class` keyword to define your exception as a class, and that you inherit the Exception class by putting it in the parentheses after the class name (which can be named whatever you want, but it's best practice to follow the same syntactical style of Python's predefined exceptions by naming it a capitalized word followed by "Error").

And just to reiterate one of the comments I wrote in the code block, the `pass` keyword does nothing and is just there so that you don't get an error for leaving the `class` body empty.

## III. Overview of error handling

Now that we've covered what exceptions are, we can start learning about how to work with exceptions in Python (aka, error handling).

The basis of error handling in Python is using "try-except blocks" to catch exceptions.

The main idea is that by coding in unique error handling, we're either telling Python "I already know that this might give an error, and I want to handle the error in this way..." or we're telling Python "I want you to catch this potential, custom error from users, and I want to handle the error in this way...".

### a) The try-except block

The two necessary keywords in a try-except block are, unsurprisingly, `try` and `except`.

All of the code in the `try` section is technically ran in Python but is not officially executed **unless** the code in the `try` section returns no error(s).

All of the code in the `except` section is **only** executed if the code in the `try` section returns an error.

You might be wondering what the usefulness is of catching Python's predefined exceptions. I mean, after all, it does seem redundant to catch an error that is already being caught by Python.

But in cases of catching Python's predefined exceptions, the usefulness lies in being able to customize the way the error is handled in the context of your program/software.

To illustrate this point, imagine you have a website that receives user requests for information about movies and all of the movie information is stored in your database on a server.

Let's say that this movie info is returned as JSON and is then converted to a dictionary in Python. In that case, if a user requests information about a movie that isn't listed in your database/dictionary, Python would return a KeyError (an error that's raised when you try returning a key's value for a key that doesn't exist).

Not only is this not really what's specifically happening (the "real" error is that the movie isn't included in the database), but also it causes the program to crash.

This is a perfect example of a case where you should catch a predefined Python exception so that your program runs smoothly.

```python
# Dictionary of movie information
movies = {
        "Annihilation": {
            "year": 2018,
            "director": "Alex Garland"
        },
        "Ready Player One": {
            "year": 2018,
            "director": "Steven Spielberg"
        },
        "Interstellar": {
            "year": 2014,
            "director": "Christopher Nolan"
        } 
    }

try:
    
    # This line won't return an error
    interstellar_info = movies["Interstellar"]
    
    # This will return a KeyError since "Wall-E" isn't a key
    # in our dictionary
    wall_e_info = movies["Wall-E"]

except KeyError:

    print("The movie you requested info for isn't listed in our database :(")
```

When you execute the code above, you completely bypass Python's built-in KeyError handling/message, and instead, our custom message is what's returned. Most importantly, we're preventing the program from crashing.

### b) Catching custom exceptions

Catching custom exceptions is the same exact process as catching predefined exceptions.

The only difference is that we of course first have to define our custom exception, as we had done earlier.
