# Benefits of setting up an e-commerce site for your coffee shop

[![a tablet sitting on top of a table next to a stack of books](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695527095316/f32d1414-ade6-4792-824a-06038f555d03.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1470374/13624)

Even if your business doesn't ship products to customers, there are many benefits to setting up an e-commerce website for your business.

More and more storefront businesses are choosing to integrate e-commerce sales channels into their business plan to generate more revenue, keep up with competitors, and reach a wider market.

Here are some of the major benefits of starting an e-commerce site for your coffee shop (**click each of the headers for more info**):

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Hedge against the risk of business closures</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">As the entire world saw very recently with the COVID-19 pandemic, unexpected events can quickly force businesses to temporarily close their doors. With an e-commerce site, you can ensure that customers can safely purchase drinks from your coffee shop online and offer curbside pickup.</div></details><details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Start selling to more customers</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">E-commerce sales channels enable businesses to virtually market to anyone in the world with a device connected to the internet. Additionally, a platform like Shopify assists businesses with integrating sales channels into their social media accounts like Instagram and Facebook. By setting up online sales funnels, you can simultaneously market and sell to a wider audience.</div></details><details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Outperform your competitors</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-nearly-70-of-us-diners-say-a-restaurants-website-has-discouraged-them-from-visiting-300909229.html" style="pointer-events: none">MGH marketing research from 2019</a>, 77% of restaurant goers say that they are likely to check out a restaurant's website before dining in or ordering takeout/delivery. Of that 77%, about 68% say that they have been discouraged from visiting a restaurant because of its website. From a competition standpoint, this means that by setting up a well-developed website for your coffee shop, you can potentially deter consumers from visiting direct competitors in your area.</div></details><details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Allow your customers to order ahead or order delivery directly from your business</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">While 3rd party food delivery platforms allow businesses to set up delivery and ordering ahead for their customers, you can also offer this same service directly through your own e-commerce website. With this approach, you have full control over how your food and beverages are marketed, and full control over the customer's checkout experience.</div></details>

# Steps to launching your Shopify site

## Start your free trial

[![a woman making candles](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695527683607/a8f180f6-214c-45d5-927f-99c95fa8269f.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1499970/13624)

Before doing anything else, make sure to [start your free 3-day trial with Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624). After your free 3 days are up, you'll get the next 3 months of Shopify for only $1.

The free 3-day trial and subsequent 3 months for $1 apply to all of Shopify's common plans (Basic, Shopify, and Advanced).

During the process of creating your Shopify account, you'll be prompted to provide the name of your coffee shop.

The default domain of your Shopify website will be storename.myshopify.com. However, you'll have the choice to use a custom domain after setting up your account.

## Add food and beverages to your Shopify site

[![a computer screen with a picture of cupcakes on it](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695529350705/1b727b6b-2e22-48e8-bc1e-51de2340ec25.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1296325/13624)

Now that your account is set up, you can start adding product pages to your Shopify website.

You can either add products one at a time or import a spreadsheet of all of your products with a CSV file.

Also, keep in mind that you can always come back to this step later to update your product listing on your Shopify website.

For each of your product pages, make sure to include a marketable description and photo of the product.

Add in customization options for your customers such as the size of the beverage, the type of milk in their beverage, add-shots of espresso, toppings, etc.

If you want to have general product pages for multiple variants, then you'll be able to do so.

For example, you might choose to have a product page for lattes where customers can choose between a caramel latte, vanilla latte, hazelnut latte and so on.

When you add variants on one product page, you'll be able to choose the price of each variant, a distinct image for each variant, and separate inventory tracking for each variant.

**For some inspiration on product page designs, check out this article:**

## Create informational pages for your business

![a woman wearing an apron standing in front of a shelf](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695530183178/89304410-0d14-4b6e-8602-01f8d9e36ae9.jpeg align="center")

Beyond just product pages, you can also add essential pages to help customers understand your coffee shop better.

Some pages you should consider including on your Shopify website include:

* Contact page
    

List your coffee shop's points of contact such as phone numbers and emails for customers to easily reach your business.

* About page
    

Establish a deeper connection with your customers by explaining the story behind your coffee shop and what motivated you to start your coffee shop.

**Read this article for some inspiration on designing your coffee shop's About page:**

[20 About Us Page Examples With Templates (2023)](http://shopify.pxf.io/vN0E6N)

If you want some inspiration for how to design your coffee shop's About page, then

* FAQ page
    

Streamline the question-and-answer process with your customers by including the most common inquiries that your business receives.

* Policy pages
    

Add in important legal information such as your website's privacy policy and terms of service.

## Choose a theme to customize your site

![a person is working on a laptop on a desk](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695530622265/81244bbb-0c12-460c-b96d-737dab2c90d6.jpeg align="center")

The [Shopify Themes marketplace](http://shopify.pxf.io/nLWVYR) has over 150 themes that you can install for your Shopify website without any coding required! While most of the themes cost money, there are some great free themes available.

On the Shopify Themes marketplace, you can filter themes by industry to view themes geared towards businesses in the Food and Drink industry.

Keep in mind that you're not stuck with whatever theme you choose and you're free to customize the theme as much as you'd like.

If you want to make detailed changes to your website's design that can't be accomplished with the user-friendly theme editor, then you'll need to edit the theme's code.

Fortunately, you can work with a Shopify Developer Partner, such as myself, to edit your theme's code.

If you want more information on the services I offer as a Shopify Developer Partner, please feel free to [schedule a free 30-minute consultation with me](https://calendly.com/salari-insite/shopify-partner-consultation).

## Choose apps to add functionality to your site

![a person holding a cell phone with a shop bag on the screen](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695531073470/e5ed2887-54ce-4d55-94b5-504e3be0093c.jpeg align="center")

The [Shopify App Store](http://shopify.pxf.io/LX5RdO) has tons of apps that you can install on your Shopify website.

Some of the tools and functionality that you can add with apps include marketing tools, sales channel integration, customer support tools, and much more.

Similar to Shopify themes, there are both paid and free Shopify apps, you can install apps without any coding required, and you can make customizations to apps by working with a Shopify Partner who knows how to code.

While it's not required to install apps for your Shopify website, apps can potentially save you time and money on operating your coffee shop.

## Add payment methods and sales channels for your business

[![a woman is looking at a laptop in a store](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695531352837/66ca0773-71c2-4cd4-b463-cabc6471eea2.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1470357/13624)

Link your Shopify store with multiple channels including [Shopify POS](http://shopify.pxf.io/anr97Z), social networks, and much more.

With [Shopify POS](http://shopify.pxf.io/anr97Z), you can easily integrate your online and in-store sales data and product inventory all under Shopify.

The best part is that when you sign up for the Basic, Shopify, or Advanced plan, you automatically get Shopify POS Lite for free with your plan!

Shopify POS Lite includes the following Shopify POS components:

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Shopify Admin</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>This is the main control center for Shopify merchants to manage all channels of their Shopify business (including their website, social channels, online marketplaces, and retail store with Shopify POS).</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Shopify's POS App</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>This is the app to install on all of your in-store devices. The Shopify POS app automatically syncs with Shopify Admin after you log in on the app.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Shopify Payments</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No need to pay for any 3rd party payment providers! Shopify Payments allows for an all-in-one Shopify POS system by processing your in-store payments.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

While you don't need to purchase any specific Shopify POS hardware to use the Shopify POS App and Shopify Payments, Shopify has a wide variety of [hardware available for purchase](http://shopify.pxf.io/XY2v7a) including card readers, tablet stands, barcode scanners, barcode printers, receipt printers, cash drawers, and much more.
