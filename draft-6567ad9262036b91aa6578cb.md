# Introduction

I recently started learning the C programming language and I thought I'd share my learnings with others by creating a series called [Journey Out to C](https://scrappedscript.com/series/journey-out-to-c).

Follow along with me while I learn the C programming language! I'll be sharing my learnings every Thursday.

## Getting started with C

### Installing the C compiler for your operating system

One of the biggest differences between a language like C and most other languages is that C is a compiled language. This of course means that to execute C programs, you first have to compile your C code. All this means is that you need to pass your C code to a compiler, which then translates the source code into machine code so that your C program can be executed by the CPU as machine instructions.

Needless to say, the first step you need to take before starting to code is to make sure that you have a compiler installed on your operating system.

My operating system is MacOS, and I already had XCode and developer tools installed, which automatically comes with the gcc compiler.

### Writing a simple hello\_world.c

Now that you have your compiler, it's time to start coding.

The next step is to write out some C code that can be compiled into machine instructions. In addition, you'll see the exact process of compiling and executing your C program(s).

I'll explain the meaning behind different elements in the code below, but for now, just know that the code sample below will print out "Hello world!" in the terminal output stream.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    printf("Hello world!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Now that you have your C code written out, save the file, give it a name, and then open up a terminal. Once you've navigated to the same directory as your C program in the terminal, type the following to compile your C program (assuming you've installed the gcc compiler):

```bash
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
```

After executing the command above, the compiler will compile your C program into machine code and store it in an executable file.

The next step is to execute the machine code by typing the following in the terminal:

```bash
./hello_world
```

After executing the above command, your computer will execute the machine code and you should see "Hello world!" printed out.

## Basic components of a C program

Now that you've written, compiled, and executed your first C program, it's time to start diving into learning the actual C language and how to program in C.

### Writing comments

In C, there are two ways of writing comments:

* in-line comments
    
* block comments
    

Here's a demonstration of the syntax for both:

```c
// in-line comment

/* 
block comment
*/
```

### The preprocessor and header files

In the very basic structure of a C program, there's a main function and then some statements above the main function. These statements above the function are processed by the preprocessor before the compiler compiles the C code.

One of the most basic examples of a preprocessor statement is one that you saw in the hello\_world.c example, `#include <stdio.h>`

In that statement, we're using the `#include` directive to tell the preprocessor to include the standard input/output header file. This header file contains a bunch of functions that allow for things such as printing output to the screen and storing input from a user.

Besides just header files, you can also put preprocessor statements to declare constants and macro definitions.

### Displaying output

As you saw in the hello\_world.c example, we can print output to the screen by using the `printf()` function (which is from the stdio.h header file).

Here's another example of displaying output:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    printf("My name is Sirus\n");

    return 0;
}
```

In the `printf()` statement above, there are a couple of things that you should pay attention to:

* the `\n`
    
    * This is a special character that represents a new line to be entered
        
* the `;`
    
    * In C, it's required to put a semi-colon after every statement
        

### Reading input

Another basic function is the `scanf()` function. This function waits for user input to be entered, and then stores the user input into variables that you define.

One cool thing you can do with both the `printf()` and `scanf()` functions is prompt a user to enter something that you're asking for.

Below is an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int i;
    
    printf("Enter your favorite integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &i);

    return 0;
}
```

When the above program is executed, the program will wait for the user to respond and then finish executing once the user hits the enter/return key on their keyboard.

In the above example, there are two new concepts to grasp from the `scanf()` function (ignore the `int i` for now):
