## I. Overview of single-page checkout

Last month, Shopify made the one-page checkout option available for all Shopify stores!

As the name implies, single-page checkout consolidates the entire checkout process into one page, making it easier and faster for customers to complete their purchases.

All of the essential form fields of an online transaction are preserved in a single-page checkout including billing and shipping information, payment information, and order summaries.

In principle, single-page checkout promotes an improved user experience, an overall simpler and faster checkout process, and reduced rates of cart abandonment.

## II. Advantages of single-page checkout

### a) Reduced cart abandonment

Single-page checkout decreases the cart abandonment rate for 3 main reasons.

According to a [2022 study from Coresight Research](https://coresight.com/research/tackling-online-cart-abandonment-how-to-convert-the-three-in-four-carts-lost-at-checkout/), the number 1 reason why customers abandon their online carts is due to extra costs being displayed at the end of the checkout process. With a single-page checkout experience, you can ensure that there are no surprises for your customers. You can dynamically update the total price as customers fill out shipping information or enter promo codes and coupons.

Second, by making the checkout process simpler, customers are less likely to become frustrated and leave your site in the middle of a transaction. With multi-page checkout, customers may feel like the process takes too much time and effort to make a purchase. Additionally, users may become frustrated if they have to go back to an earlier page in the checkout process to change a detail in one of the form fields.

The final reason that single-page checkout reduces the cart abandonment rate is that you're making the checkout process faster and more streamlined. If customers spend more time at the checkout process, they may second-guess making the purchase and become indecisive.

### b) Improved user experience

There are 2 main factors at play for why single-page checkout improves the user experience during the checkout process.

Since only that one page has to load for the customer to finalize the purchase, there's less concern about page load speed. In multi-page checkout, there are more opportunities for a page to load slowly during the process, damaging the overall user experience. Users don't like waiting long for pages to load!

The other factor at play is that you're making the checkout experience easier to edit and review for the customer. Sometimes we make mistakes filling out online order forms as customers, and it can be annoying to have to go back to an earlier page to make a simple edit to some detail in a form field. With single-page checkout, customers can quickly review the information entered and rapidly make any necessary changes.

### c) Lowered complexity

Single-page checkout not only reduces complexity for customers but also reduces complexity for the business.

Think about it like this: when a customer adds an item to their cart, they already consciously make the choice that they *want* the product or service. This means that they want nothing else in the world than to simply be able to purchase that product or service with no unnecessary and complex obstacles. By making the online transaction seem like this complicated side quest with multiple pages, the customer might feel like they have to put too much effort into navigating the checkout process.

For the business, single-page checkout simplifies the development process. The business doesn't have to spend as much time and money on designing, developing, and managing multiple checkout pages.
