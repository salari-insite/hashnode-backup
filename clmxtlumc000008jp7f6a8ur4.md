# 5 Reasons to Choose Shopify for Your Business

## [Long Trial Period](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624)

[![a packed shipping box](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695000317810/c5e94ab2-18e8-40d2-bc60-157df8067530.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1499969/13624)

When it comes to running a business, every single choice you make carries a risk.

Shopify's trial period helps to reduce the risks associated with launching a new business, migrating from another e-commerce site, and testing if e-commerce should be integrated into your business model.

When you [sign up for Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624), you get a free 3-day trial with no credit card required at sign up.

After your free 3-day trial, you can continue to run your business with Shopify for only $1/month for your first 3 months!

After your trial period is over, choose from an array of Shopify solutions starting at [$5/month](http://shopify.pxf.io/9gyqK4)!

## [Convert Your Instagram and Facebook Followers to Customers](http://shopify.pxf.io/XY2E7y)

[![a cell phone with a picture of a woman's face](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694999766189/18df5cd8-1887-4752-bd75-d37ebef9ab1c.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1296283/13624?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopify.com%2Ffacebook-instagram)

Long gone are the days of social media just being a marketing channel for businesses.

Shopify has all the tools and support your business needs to [turn your social media accounts into sales channels](http://shopify.pxf.io/XY2E7y).

As a Shopify merchant, you'll have the ability to sync your product catalog and inventory with Facebook and Instagram, offer one-tap checkout, and access many customization features to help you boost your brand's marketability.

## [Access to Marketing Tools](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1101159/13624)

[![a set of four screens displaying different forms](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694999396405/067883cc-644f-44c2-a317-9dc340e13ec4.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1751933/13624?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopify.com%2Fmarketing-tools)

Shopify offers a wide range of [marketing tools](http://shopify.pxf.io/anrDaY) to merchants.

With their automation tools to connect with customers, you get to save valuable time that would be spent on customer support.

Additionally, you can integrate sales data to segment your market and use powerful marketing techniques to target the right customers.

Lastly, you can create customized email and form templates to promote meaningful relationships with your valued customers and market new products and promotions.

## [Customize Your Website with Themes](http://shopify.pxf.io/nLWVYR)

[![a cell phone with the text turn your passion into an empire](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694999241392/f2232ad7-6d4c-447f-834c-e31da912167a.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1296184/13624)

Shopify offers a [large selection of free and paid themes](http://shopify.pxf.io/nLWVYR) that merchants can implement onto their Shopify website.

Shopify themes enable you to add modern, mobile-friendly web design to your Shopify website without ever needing to write a single line of code.

Each Shopify theme comes with features that you can easily add or remove with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.

While there are no coding skills required to implement Shopify themes, you will need to edit code if there's a specific design or feature you want on your website that isn't offered with any of the Shopify themes currently available.

Fortunately, you have the option of contracting a Shopify Developer Partner, such as myself, to get the job done for you.

As a Shopify Developer Partner, I offer a variety of services to both prospective and current Shopify merchants including theme development, app development, and much more!

If you want more information on the services I offer as a Shopify Developer Partner, please feel free to [schedule a free 30-minute consultation with me](https://calendly.com/salari-insite/shopify-partner-consultation).

## [Sell Online and Offline Under One Platform](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1296919/13624?POS=)

[![a woman standing in front of a laptop computer](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694998826742/086d7e66-fe3f-47c7-b583-670153b3ed45.png align="center")](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/4786087/1470354/13624)

Shopify is the best commerce solution for businesses that have both an e-commerce site and a brick-and-mortar store.

With [Shopify POS](http://shopify.pxf.io/anr97Z), you can easily integrate your online and in-store sales data and product inventory all under Shopify.

The best part is that when you sign up for the Basic, Shopify, or Advanced plan, you automatically get Shopify POS Lite for free with your plan!

Shopify POS Lite includes the following Shopify POS components:

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" colwidth="200"><p><strong>Shopify Admin</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>This is the main control center for Shopify merchants to manage all channels of their Shopify business (including their website, social channels, online marketplaces, and retail store with Shopify POS).</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" colwidth="200"><p><strong>Shopify's POS App</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>This is the app to install on all of your in-store devices. The Shopify POS app automatically syncs with Shopify Admin after you log in on the app.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" colwidth="200"><p><strong>Shopify Payments</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No need to pay for any 3rd party payment providers! Shopify Payments allows for an all-in-one Shopify POS system by processing your in-store payments.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

While you don't need to purchase any specific Shopify POS hardware to use the Shopify POS App and Shopify Payments, Shopify has a wide variety of [hardware available for purchase](http://shopify.pxf.io/XY2v7a) including card readers, tablet stands, barcode scanners, barcode printers, receipt printers, cash drawers, and much more.

Even if your business doesn't have a physical storefront, Shopify POS gives you the opportunity to sell your products "on the go" at pop-up events and market meet-ups.
