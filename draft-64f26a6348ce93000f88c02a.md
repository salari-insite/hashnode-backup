While linear algebra originated as a branch of "pure mathematics," its applications have since expanded significantly beyond the mathematical domain. In this article, I'll go in-depth on explaining the core linear algebra concepts and theories that play a significant role in computer science.

This article is part of a series called **Log Base Two**; this series is dedicated to exploring the intricate relationship between mathematics and computer science.

My mission with this series is to show other people that math isn't so scary if you break down mathematical concepts into digestible bouts of information and investigate use cases of math in your primary field of interest. Most importantly, I want to supplement your understanding of math. I believe that **everyone** is capable of learning and loving mathematics.

Just to give a bit of background on my experience in math, I've excelled in a total of 10 college courses in math:

1. Single-variable differential calculus
    
2. Single-variable integral calculus
    
3. Multi-variable differential and integral calculus
    
4. Multi-variable differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions
    
5. Linear Algebra
    
6. Differential equations
    
7. Probability and statistics
    
8. Data analysis using R programming language
    
9. Multivariate statistics
    
10. Discrete math
    

New articles in this series are posted every Thursday. Stay tuned for next week's article where I explain the use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in machine learning algorithms!

# What Even is Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra is a subfield of mathematics that concentrates on linear systems, matrices, and vectors. Through the employment of these three fundamental elements, a multitude of advancements have been achieved in various domains, both within and beyond the sphere of mathematics.

## Why Haven't I Heard About Linear Algebra Before?

Typically, the first opportunity to take a course in linear algebra is in your 2nd or 3rd year of college. Additionally, colleges usually require you to pass single-variable calculus before being able to enroll in linear algebra.

On top of this, most non-STEM majors in college don't require students to pass any college-level math past single-variable calculus and statistics.

The funny thing is that linear algebra isn't *harder* than calculus. A majority of my classmates in university, myself included, believe that linear algebra is actually a bit *easier* than calculus.

Also, linear algebra doesn't directly use any tools or concepts from calculus, so you can't even make the argument that you first need to gain prerequisite information from calculus to understand linear algebra.

So if linear algebra isn't harder than calculus, and there's no prerequisite information gained from calculus, then why does it seem so exclusive and "higher level"?

While I don't have an official answer, I have a valid opinion as to why (based on my personal experience of taking a bunch of college-level math courses and seeing how each is used).

I believe that it comes down to these two main factors

# Basic Concepts of Linear Algebra

To focus on the computer science aspects of this article, I won't delve too deeply into explaining linear algebra itself. However, I will provide some basic information for those who are entirely unfamiliar with linear algebra or simply need a quick refresher.

I'm going to cover these nine key ideas in linear algebra:

* Linear systems
    
* Matrices and Gaussian elimination
    
* Vectors and vector spaces
    
* Orthogonality
    
* Determinants
    
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    
* Diagonalization and symmetric matrices
    
* Linear transformations
    
* Singular value decomposition
    

To fully grasp how linear algebra is applied in computer science, it's necessary to first understand those nine concepts in linear algebra.

If you already possess some knowledge of linear algebra, feel free to skip to the section where I begin discussing direct applications of linear algebra in computer science.

## Linear systems

A linear system can be defined as an assembly of multiple linear equations that share a common set of variables. These equations are interconnected, and their solutions are represented by the values of the variables that simultaneously satisfy all the equations within the system.

### Linear equations

A linear equation is an equation that consists of *n* variables each with a degree of 1.

The general form of a linear equation is:

$$a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = b$$

The 3 main components of a linear equation are:

* a set of coefficients
    

$$\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$$

* a set of variables
    

$$\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$$

* a constant *b*
    

In linear systems of equations, each equation contains the same set of variables but doesn't necessarily have the same set of coefficients.

Putting together a system of *m* linear equations takes the general form:

$$a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \ldots + a_{1n} x_n = b_1$$

$$a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \ldots + a_{2n} x_n = b_2$$

$$\vdots$$

$$a_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2 + \ldots + a_{mn} x_n = b_m$$

### Simultaneous solution

The main idea behind a system of equations is that all equations within the system can be solved *simultaneously*.

By doing so, it becomes possible to find a unique solution, or a set of solutions, that satisfies all the given equations, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem at hand.
