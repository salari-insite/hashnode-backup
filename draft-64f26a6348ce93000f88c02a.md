While linear algebra originated as a branch of "pure mathematics," its applications have since expanded significantly beyond the mathematical domain. In this article, we will explore the foundations of linear algebra, highlight the areas of computer science that incorporate its principles, and elucidate how it is applied within each respective field.

# Basic Concepts of Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a subfield of mathematics that concentrates on linear systems, matrices, and vectors. Through the employment of these three fundamental elements, a multitude of advancements have been achieved in various domains, both within and beyond the sphere of mathematics.

To focus on the computer science aspects of this article, I won't delve too deeply into explaining linear algebra itself. However, I will provide some basic information for those who are entirely unfamiliar with linear algebra or simply need a quick refresher.

I'm going to cover these nine key ideas in linear algebra:

* Linear systems
    
* Matrices and Gaussian elimination
    
* Vectors and vector spaces
    
* Orthogonality
    
* Determinants
    
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    
* Diagonalization and symmetric matrices
    
* Linear transformations
    
* Singular value decomposition
    

To fully grasp how linear algebra is applied in computer science, it's necessary to first understand those nine concepts in linear algebra.

If you already possess some knowledge of linear algebra, feel free to skip to the section where I begin discussing direct applications of linear algebra in computer science.

## Linear systems

A linear system can be defined as an assembly of multiple linear equations that share a common set of variables. These equations are interconnected, and their solutions are represented by the values of the variables that simultaneously satisfy all the equations within the system.

### Linear equations

A linear equation is an equation that consists of *n* variables each with a degree of 1.

The general form of a linear equation is:

$$a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = b$$

The 3 main components of a linear equation are:

* a set of coefficients
    

$$\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$$

* a set of variables
    

$$\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$$

* a constant *b*
    

In linear systems of equations, each equation contains the same set of variables, but doesn't necessarily have the same set of coefficients.

Putting together a system of *m* linear equations takes the general form:

$$a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \ldots + a_{1n} x_n = b_1$$

 $$ a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \ldots + a_{2n} x_n = b_2$$

$$\vdots$$

 $$ a_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2 + \ldots + a_{mn} x_n = b_m$$

### Simultaneous solution

The main idea behind a system of equations is that all equations within the system can be solved *simultaneously*.

By doing so, it becomes possible to find a unique solution, or a set of solutions, that satisfies all the given equations, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem at hand.
