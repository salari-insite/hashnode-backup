# Introduction

In this article, we will delve into two basic sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. We will explore their steps, implementation in code, time complexity, advantages, and disadvantages, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental sorting techniques.

Whether you're a beginner in computer science or a seasoned programmer, this comparison will sharpen your knowledge and help you make informed decisions when choosing the right sorting algorithm for your projects.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort works by comparing two values at a time and sorting those two values as it iterates through the entire list.

You can think of it as if it's creating a bubble of the list every time it compares two consecutive values.

If the list is still not sorted through the first list iteration, then the bubble sort algorithm repeats till the list is fully sorted.

Just from the description, you may already tell that the bubble sort algorithm is not an efficient sorting algorithm.

However, bubble sort is a good algorithm for beginner software engineers to study and understand so that they grasp the foundational concepts of algorithms in general.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Start at the first two elements in the list
    
2. Compare those elements
    
3. Swap those elements if they're not sorted
    
4. Move to the next two elements and repeat steps 2 and 3
    
5. Repeat steps 1-4 till you reach the end of the list
    
6. Repeat steps 1-5 till the list is sorted
    

### Code Snippet

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):

    # Iterate through list (n - 1) times
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        
        # Iterate through entire list first time
        # Subsequently chop last element from iteration
        for j in range(len(arr) - i - 1):
            
            # If the element before the other element is greater,
            # swap their order
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:

                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

# Example Usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
```
