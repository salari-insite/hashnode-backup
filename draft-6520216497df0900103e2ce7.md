**This article is part of a series called "**[**Log Base Two**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/log-base-two)**", a series dedicated to the relationship between math and computer science**.

Just to give a bit of background on my experience in math, I've **excelled** in a total of 10 college courses in math:

1. **Single-variable differential calculus**
    
2. **Single-variable integral calculus**
    
3. **Multi-variable differential and integral calculus**
    
4. **Multi-variable differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions**
    
5. **Linear Algebra**
    
6. **Differential equations**
    
7. **Probability and statistics**
    
8. **Data analysis using R programming language**
    
9. **Multivariate statistics**
    
10. **Discrete math**
    

For a large majority of those 10 classes, I ended up with A's.

Although, before college, I struggled a lot with math in the classroom, even though math had always been my favorite subject since I was in elementary school. I found it hard to truly grasp the concepts taught because my high school teachers were too focused on skill assessment. Instead of focusing on the actual concept being taught, I was too worried about how I was going to pass the test the following week.

Once I got to college, I realized that your math grade (or any grade for that matter) truly doesn't define your potential. Further, I'd argue that your success in math *education* is heavily influenced by the quality of the teacher/professor's teaching.

My mission with this series is to show other people that math isn't so scary if you break down mathematical concepts into digestible bouts of information and investigate use cases of math in your primary field of interest (in this case, computer science). Along the way, I hope to also supplement your math education with quality content. I believe that **everyone** is capable of learning and truly loving mathematics.

**New articles in this series are posted every Thursday!**

## I. Overview of logic

Our ability to reason using logic is perhaps one of the most defining qualities of what makes us human.

Even when we're being "overly emotional", we're technically still using logic. Albeit, this type of logic is usually based on fallacies.

For instance, if you choose to never visit a restaurant again because you got food poisoning from it one time, you're using logic based on your personal experience of the painful torment you had to endure that will forever be tied to that restaurant in your mind.

Alternatively, if you got food poisoning from a restaurant once but choose to keep dining at the restaurant, maybe your logical defense is that you've eaten at the restaurant hundreds of times so that one time is not statistically significant.

In both of those cases of reasoning, you're forming an argument constructed from a logical relationship between 2 propositions.

In the first case, your root, refined argument is: "*If I get food poisoning from a restaurant, then I'll get food poisoning from the restaurant again.*" The first proposition is "*If I get food poisoning from a restaurant*", and the second proposition is "*I'll get food poisoning from the restaurant again*". You then logically construct your argument by connecting these 2 propositions with an "if...then" statement. Whether this argument is true or not is another story.

In the second case, your root, refined argument is: "*If I get food poisoning from a restaurant less than 1% of the hundreds of times I've eaten there, then it is due to random chance.*" The first proposition is "*If I get food poisoning from a restaurant less than 1% of the hundreds of times I've eaten there*", and the second proposition is "*It is due to random chance*". Once again, you connect these 2 propositions using an "if...then" statement to form your argument.

At this point, it should be noted that sometimes, certain arguments can be incredibly hard to prove or disprove, and sometimes even **impossible** to prove or disprove.

For the first argument to be true, all that has to happen is you get food poisoning from the restaurant at least once more. Theoretically, you could get food poisoning from the restaurant again the very next month and conclusively prove your argument true. Alternatively, for the first argument to be false, you'd have to never get food poisoning from the restaurant again in your life. Although, assuming you live for a long time, it could take decades before this argument can conclusively be proven false.

On the other hand, the second argument is very hard to prove true or false from the get-go. This is because even if you never get food poisoning again from that restaurant, you can't definitively say that that one time was due to pure random chance. Perhaps you unknowingly were on a date with the chef's ex-significant other at the restaurant, and the jealous chef purposely spoiled your food.

While it may seem like I'm being unrealistic and overly cynical about this whole story above, there are even cases in pure math where a particular argument can simply never be proven or disproven.

One of my favorite mathematicians of all time, Kurt GÃ¶del, proved his "incompleteness theorems" showing that there can exist statements about/within a formal system that can't be proven or disproven and that the formal system itself can not prove that its own rules are logically consistent.

For instance, our second argument in our story about food poisoning might be true based on statistical *inference*, but as I stated, this doesn't mean that it can be *proven* true. Essentially, that argument is only as true as the statistical inference you're making, and that inference itself is based on conditions/rules that can't be proven to be logically consistent.

Now that you're mind is blown, let's break down the components of arguments and logical reasoning.

### a) Propositional variables

In discrete math, we typically represent propositions as variables for convenience.

Usually, the standard variables used for an argument with 2 propositions are *P* and *Q.*

For example, for the first argument in our food poisoning story, we'd define the propositions as:

$$P = If\hspace{5px}I\hspace{5px}get\hspace{5px}food\hspace{5px}poisoning\hspace{5px}from\hspace{5px}a\hspace{5px}restaurant$$

 $$ Q = I'll\hspace{5px}get\hspace{5px}food\hspace{5px}poisoning\hspace{5px}again$$

### b) Logical operations and connectives

The 5 rudimentary connectives/operators in propositional logic are:

* Implication (if...then)
    

$$P \Rightarrow Q$$

* Bidirectional (if, and only if,...)
    

$$P \Leftrightarrow Q$$

* Conjunction (and)
    

$$P \land Q$$

* Disjunction (or)
    

$$P \lor Q$$

* Negation (not)
    

$$\lnot P$$

### c) Truth tables

To systematically and conveniently show that an argument is true, we use truth tables.

In a truth table, you essentially consider every possible case of an argument to logically show whether an argument is true or false.

For an argument with 2 propositions, there are 4 unique cases: both propositions are true, both propositions are false, only the first proposition is true, and only the second proposition is true.

Let's write out the basic truth tables for all 5 of those rudimentary connectives/operators.

**Implication**

| *P* | *Q* | *P* --&gt; *Q* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| True | True | True |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | True |
| False | False | True |

As we see for an argument involving 2 propositions, an implication is only false when the first proposition is true but the second proposition is false.

Intuitively, this makes sense.

For instance, consider the following implication:

$$P: x = 2$$

 $$ Q: 3x = 5$$

 $$ P \Rightarrow Q$$

In this case, if *P* is taken as true, then we can assume that *Q* is false (since if x = 2, then 3x would equal 6). Therefore, our implication itself is false.

One implication truth-value that might not make sense right away is how the implication "if *P* is false, then *Q* is true" is a true implication.

Consider the following implication:

$$P: It's\hspace{5px}always\hspace{5px}sunny\hspace{5px}outside$$

 $$ Q: The\hspace{5px}sun\hspace{5px}is\hspace{5px}always\hspace{5px}shining\hspace{5px}onto\hspace{5px}Earth$$

$$P \Rightarrow Q$$

Since there are sometimes clouds in the atmosphere, we can take *P* as sometimes false. Although, since the Earth is always in the path of the sun's light, we can take *Q* as always true. However, for the implication itself, it's logically true to say that if it's always sunny outside, then the sun is always shining onto the Earth.

**Bidirectional**

To construct our bidirectional truth table, let's first think about what a bidirectional argument means in the context of implication.

In a bidirectional argument, we're essentially making an implication that works both ways.

Therefore, let's construct our bidirectional truth table with this in mind by making a column for "if *Q*, then *P*".

| *P* | *Q* | *P* --&gt; *Q* | *Q* --&gt; *P* | *P* &lt;--&gt; *Q* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| True | True | True | True | True |
| True | False | False | True | False |
| False | True | True | False | False |
| False | False | True | True | True |

As we see for an argument involving 2 propositions, a bidirectional argument is only true when P and Q are logically equivalent (they have the same truth-vaues). So either *P* and *Q* are both true, or they're both false.

Consider the following bidirectional argument:

$$P: Penguins\hspace{5px}can\hspace{5px}fly$$

$$Q: All\hspace{5px}birds\hspace{5px}can\hspace{5px}fly $$

 $$P \Leftrightarrow Q$$

Our argument is "Penguins can fly if, and only if, all birds can fly". As you may already know, penguins can't fly, therefore not all birds can fly (so both propositions are false). Although, the bidirectional argument itself is true.

**Conjunction**

The other 3 connectives/operators are relatively straightforward.

Also, as a side note, these remaining 3 connectives/operators don't form complete arguments on their own but rather are used as components of an argument.

The conjunction of 2 propositions forms the statement "*P* and *Q*".

In terms of truth-value, a conjunction of 2 propositions is only true when both propositions are true.
