# Introduction

**This article is part of a series called "**[**Log Base Two**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/log-base-two)**", a series dedicated to the relationship between math and computer science**.

Just to give a bit of background on my experience in math, I've **excelled** in a total of 10 college courses in math:

1. **Single-variable differential calculus**
    
2. **Single-variable integral calculus**
    
3. **Multi-variable differential and integral calculus**
    
4. **Multi-variable differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions**
    
5. **Linear Algebra**
    
6. **Differential equations**
    
7. **Probability and statistics**
    
8. **Data analysis using R programming language**
    
9. **Multivariate statistics**
    
10. **Discrete math**
    

For a large majority of those 10 classes, I ended up with A's.

Although, before college, I struggled a lot with math in the classroom, even though math had always been my favorite subject since I was in elementary school. I found it hard to truly grasp the concepts taught because my high school teachers were too focused on skill assessment. Instead of focusing on the actual concept being taught, I was too worried about how I was going to pass the test the following week.

Once I got to college, I realized that your math grade (or any grade for that matter) truly doesn't define your potential. Further, I'd argue that your success in math *education* is heavily influenced by the quality of the teacher/professor's teaching.

My mission with this series is to show other people that math isn't so scary if you break down mathematical concepts into digestible bouts of information and investigate use cases of math in your primary field of interest (in this case, computer science). Along the way, I hope to also supplement your math education with quality content. I believe that **everyone** is capable of learning and truly loving mathematics.

**New articles in this series are posted every Thursday!**
