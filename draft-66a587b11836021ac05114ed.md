## Introduction

Last summer, I built my first portfolio website using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP for handling a contact form. At that time, I was just starting my bachelor's degree in computer science and had only taken courses in discrete mathematics and introductory programming. Although I had spent some time in the previous years teaching myself programming (mainly web development), I still didn't have enough knowledge to create a good-looking and well-functioning website.

One year later, I have now completed courses in assembly and computer architecture, web development, data structures, algorithms, and databases. I've learned a lot over the past year, and I felt it was necessary to update my portfolio site. Instead of just updating the existing codebase, I decided to start from scratch to make significant changes to the functionality, design, and content of the site.

For my new portfolio site, I wanted to highlight my projects and skills, use the Hashnode API to show a grid of my blog posts, and add some AI features. After thinking it over, I decided the best way to include AI was to create a personalized chatbot. This chatbot can chat about my projects, skills, and interests. It not only showcases my technical abilities but also makes the site more engaging, helping visitors learn more about me in a fun and creative way.

## Tech Stack and Tools

Building my personal website was an exciting journey that involved using various technologies and tools, each chosen for its specific benefits and how it fit into the overall vision for the site. The goal was to create a responsive, modern, and engaging platform to showcase my work, skills, and projects. Here's an overview of the tech stack and tools I used:

* **Frontend Development**: For crafting the UI, I decided to go with React and Tailwind
    
* **Backend Development**: The server-side logic was built with Node.js and Express
    

In the following sections, I'll explore each part of the stack, detailing the specific technologies, their roles, and why I chose them. This comprehensive tech stack enabled me to build a seamless, full-stack application that meets my needs and is also maintainable and scalable for the future.

### Frontend

The frontend of my website was developed using modern web technologies that emphasize performance, aesthetics, and ease of development. Here's a breakdown of the key tools and libraries I used:

1. **React**: As a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React was the backbone of my frontend development. Its component-based architecture allowed me to create reusable and modular UI components, making it easier to manage the site's structure and functionality.
    
2. **Tailwind**: For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It provided a flexible and efficient way to design the layout and look of the website without writing custom CSS from scratch. The responsive design utilities in Tailwind helped ensure that the site looks great on all devices. Plus, it's incredibly easy to add light and dark mode styling with Tailwind.
    
3. **React Router**: To handle navigation within the site, I used React Router. This library allowed me to create a smooth, single-page application experience by managing different routes and pages without needing full page reloads.
    
4. **Axios**: For handling API requests, such as sending chatbot messages to my server, I used Axios. Its promise-based HTTP client made it easy to interact with APIs and manage asynchronous data fetching.
    
5. **Vite**: To streamline the development process, I used Vite, a build tool that offers fast development server start times and optimized production builds. Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature was particularly useful during development, as it allowed for immediate updates to the site whenever I made changes.
    
6. **React Icons**: To enhance the visual appeal and provide intuitive navigation, I integrated various icons from the React Icons library. This library offers a wide range of icons that are easy to use and customize, fitting perfectly with the overall design of my site.
    
7. **Custom components and hooks**: I developed several custom components and hooks to handle specific functions, like the chatbot and theme switcher. This approach not only improved the site's performance but also made the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
    

These tools and technologies, along with careful planning and design, created a frontend that is both user-friendly and visually appealing. Choosing a modern tech stack also ensures that my website is scalable and easy to update as new trends and technologies emerge.

### Backend

The backend of my personal website is designed to efficiently manage data, handle API requests, and provide the frontend with the necessary resources. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies and practices I used:

* **Node.js and Express**: I chose Node.js for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is perfect for building scalable network applications. I used Express, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, to create a RESTful API for the chatbot and manage routing. Its lightweight nature and extensive middleware ecosystem made it an ideal choice for quickly setting up the server.
    
* **API Integration**: The backend includes a custom API for receiving user queries sent to the chatbot. This API-first approach ensures that the website can easily be expanded or modified in the future, allowing new features to be integrated seamlessly.
