## Introduction

Last summer, I built my first portfolio website using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP for handling a contact form. At that time, I was just starting my bachelor's degree in computer science and had only taken courses in discrete mathematics and introductory programming. Although I had spent some time in the previous years teaching myself programming (mainly web development), I still didn't have enough knowledge to create a good-looking and well-functioning website.

One year later, I have now completed courses in assembly and computer architecture, web development, data structures, algorithms, and databases. I've learned a lot over the past year, and I felt it was necessary to update my portfolio site. Instead of just updating the existing codebase, I decided to start from scratch to make significant changes to the functionality, design, and content of the site.

For my new portfolio site, I wanted to highlight my projects and skills, use the Hashnode API to show a grid of my blog posts, and add some AI features. After thinking it over, I decided the best way to include AI was to create a personalized chatbot. This chatbot can chat about my projects, skills, and interests. It not only showcases my technical abilities but also makes the site more engaging, helping visitors learn more about me in a fun and creative way.
