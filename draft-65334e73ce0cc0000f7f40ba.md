In this article, I'm going to cover the top 5 SEO apps that I recommend for boosting your Shopify site's SEO and driving more traffic to your shop.

Keep in mind that SEO strategy requires a multi-faceted approach where you tackle issues in all kinds of areas. As such, all of these apps offer something entirely different from each other.

Also, as a side note, all of these apps are Built for Shopify. This is a badge acquired when app developers go above and beyond to make sure that they not only meet Shopify's app store requirements but also create the perfect product experience for merchants. This means that you can trust all of these apps I listed in this article have been heavily vetted and backed by Shopify and merchants.
