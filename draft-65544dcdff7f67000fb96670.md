## I. Importance of starting an online business

Starting an online business is important for first-time entrepreneurs because it offers lower startup costs, greater flexibility, access to a global market, and the ability to scale quickly. It also allows you to experiment with different business ideas, adapt to market changes, and work from anywhere with an internet connection.

While you can also have an offline extension of your business such as a physical store or providing in-person services, you should start your business by setting up an eCommerce website on a platform such as Shopify and setting up online sales channels.

## II. Research and planning

The first step to starting any business is to spend time researching your market and theorizing a business plan that accounts for all the logistical details of your business.

This is important so that you carefully consider how to create a successful and profitable business.

Without proper planning and research, you run the risk of starting a business that digs its own grave from the start (even if you have an amazing product or service).

Additionally, having a solid plan ensures that you're not making stuff up as you go. Having a foundational roadmap for your business establishes you as a serious and professional business owner. This is what differentiates your idea from being either a successful business or a small side hustle.

### a) Identifying your niche

One of the most important components of researching and planning for a business is to identify and choose the market that you're going to sell to!

Instead of trying to appeal to everyone in the world, you should dial in on a specific audience.

This not only makes it easier on you when it comes to planning your marketing and sales strategies, but it also helps to build your credibility and recognizability for your audience.

Sometimes this step requires identifying subniches (such as when your niche is too broad or saturated).

Let's say that you want to start an event planning business and you want to specifically provide wedding planning services, for example. Consider your background and the wedding planning industry to choose a niche.

For instance, maybe you want to incorporate your cultural background into your business model, then your chosen niche could be other people from your cultural background.

Or maybe you grew up by the beach and love the beach life. In that case, your niche could be an audience who wants to have a beachside wedding.

### b) Analyzing market demand and competition

### c) Creating a business plan

### d) Setting realistic goals and expectations

This article is part of a series called [**Cache In Cash Out**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/cache-in-cash-out), a series where I help educate and inform established businesses, aspiring entrepreneurs, and independent developers about Shopify.

Shopify powers millions of businesses and is trusted by brands such as Unilever, Kylie Cosmetics, Allbirds, and many more.

As someone who values freedom through entrepreneurship, I love how [**Shopify's Mission**](http://shopify.pxf.io/5g1zrD) is to reduce the barriers to becoming a business owner by providing a platform that makes it easier to launch and grow a business.

No matter where you are on your journey, Shopify fosters a culture that empowers individuals who are seeking independence in the form of starting their own business.
