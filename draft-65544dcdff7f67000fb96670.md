## I. Importance of starting an online business

Starting an online business is important for first-time entrepreneurs because it offers lower startup costs, greater flexibility, access to a global market, and the ability to scale quickly. It also allows you to experiment with different business ideas, adapt to market changes, and work from anywhere with an internet connection.

While you can also have an offline extension of your business such as a physical store or providing in-person services, you should start your business by setting up an eCommerce website on a platform such as Shopify and setting up online sales channels.

This article is part of a series called [**Cache In Cash Out**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/cache-in-cash-out), a series where I help educate and inform established businesses, aspiring entrepreneurs, and independent developers about Shopify.

Shopify powers millions of businesses and is trusted by brands such as Unilever, Kylie Cosmetics, Allbirds, and many more.

As someone who values freedom through entrepreneurship, I love how [**Shopify's Mission**](http://shopify.pxf.io/5g1zrD) is to reduce the barriers to becoming a business owner by providing a platform that makes it easier to launch and grow a business.

No matter where you are on your journey, Shopify fosters a culture that empowers individuals who are seeking independence in the form of starting their own business.
