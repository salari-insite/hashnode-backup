This article is part of a series called [**Cache In Cash Out**](https://scrappedscript.com/series/cache-in-cash-out), a series where I help educate and inform established businesses, aspiring entrepreneurs, and independent developers about Shopify.

Shopify powers millions of businesses and is trusted by brands such as Unilever, Kylie Cosmetics, Allbirds, and many more.

As someone who values freedom through entrepreneurship, I love how [**Shopify's Mission**](http://shopify.pxf.io/5g1zrD) is to reduce the barriers to becoming a business owner by providing a platform that makes it easier to launch and grow a business.

No matter where you are on your journey, Shopify fosters a culture that empowers individuals who are seeking independence in the form of starting their own business.
