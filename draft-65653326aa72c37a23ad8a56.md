# Introduction

> In this article, we discuss how to install Keras and Skimage, and how to perform image augmentation using the ImageDataGenerator object from Keras. We cover importing required modules, defining image transformations, loading and reshaping images, and generating augmented images. This tutorial will help you create and save augmented images for your machine-learning projects.

## How to install Keras

To install Keras, you have to install the TensorFlow package.

To install TensorFlow:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

After installing the TensorFlow package, you've now installed Keras onto your system.

To use Keras in your Python file:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
```

## How to install Skimage

To load in our image, we'll be using SciKit, but you may wish to use another library to load in your image if you'd prefer.

To install Skimage:

```bash
pip install scikit-image
```

## Image augmentation

To start, make sure to import the required modules into your Python file:

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from skimage import io
```

### ImageDataGenerator object

The next step is to use the ImageDataGenerator object from Keras to define how you want the augmented image(s) to be transformed:

```python
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=40,  # randomly rotate images in the range (degrees, 0 to 180)
    width_shift_range=0.2,  # randomly shift images horizontally (fraction of total width)
    height_shift_range=0.2,  # randomly shift images vertically (fraction of total height)
    shear_range=0.2,  # set range for random shear
    zoom_range=0.2,  # set range for random zoom
    horizontal_flip=True,  # randomly flip images
    fill_mode='nearest')  # set mode for filling points outside the input boundaries
```

When you set 'fill\_mode' to 'nearest', any space created in the augmented images will be filled with colored pixels that match the colors of the pixels near the space.

Another option for 'fill\_mode' is to set it to 'constant'. When you set it to constant, the space in the augmented images will be filled with black pixels by default. If you want to use grey or white pixels, you can do so by including a 2nd argument after 'fill\_mode', like so: "fill\_mode='nearest', '150'".

### Load image and reshape

In this step, you'll load your image into Python. Additionally, we'll be reshaping the image array data.

```python
input_image = io.imread('path/to/image')
input_image = input_image.reshape((1,) + input_image.shape)
```

### Generate *x* augmented images

The final step is to generate your augmented images!

The following code demonstrates creating and saving 20 augmented images:

```python
i = 0
for batch in datagen.flow(input_image, batch_size=16, save_to_dir='path/to/save/images', save_prefix='prefix', save_format='jpeg'):
        i += 1
        if i == 19:
            break
```

In the above code, we're calling the .flow function on our ImageDataGenerator object and passing in our input\_image, a batch size of 16 (this means it will augment 16 sample images at a time), specifying the directory to save the augmented images, specifying the prefix to put at the beginning of all the file names, and finally, the file format of the augmented images.
