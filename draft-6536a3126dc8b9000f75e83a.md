# Introduction

## Definition of control flow

Control flow is the order in which a program's instructions are executed and is determined by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

It allows a program to make decisions, repeat specific tasks, and organize code into reusable functions, enabling complex algorithms and dynamic behavior.

Without control flow, a program would just be a long laundry list of predefined instructions.

Although, control flow allows your program to be able to handle user inputs/behavior, and be able to pivot the outputs/behavior of the program based on the user inputs/behavior.

## Overview of control flow in Python

In Python, control flow mainly consists of conditional statements (if, elif, and else), conditional/unconditional loops (for and while loops), and loop control statements (break, continue, and pass).

Another popular control flow method in other programming languages is switch/case statements. Up until very recently, Python didn't have the capability for switch/case statements. However, with the release of Python 3.10 in 2021, switch/case statements are now supported in Python.

I won't be covering switch/case statements in this article since they're still very new in the Python language, and they're not as widely used as the control flow methods I'll be covering.

Further, the logic of switch/case statements is very similar to if/elif/else statements. Traditionally, switch/case statements are used instead of if/elif/else statements if there are many different conditions/cases that the program has to handle.

Although, for general control flow, switch/case statements aren't always necessary.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in Python are structured as a hierarchy of statements where the first statement is made with the "if" keyword. It should be noted that it is sufficient enough to *just* have an "if" statement. Although, you can also add another conditional statement starting with the "else" keyword after the "if" statement. Finally, if you need to control other conditions in your program, then you can do so with conditional statements placed in between the "if" and "else" statements and made with the "elif" keyword.

The logic behind conditional statements is:

1. If this condition is met/if this is a true statement: do this...
    
2. Elif this condition is met/if this is a true statement: do this...
    
3. Else: do this...
    

The if statement checks a condition, and if it's True, the code block within it is executed. The elif statement checks another condition if the previous conditions are not met. The else statement executes a code block if **none** of the previous conditions are met.

### The 'if' statement

The if statement begins with the "if" keyword, followed by a statement that returns a Boolean value (True or False).

As such, when you're checking if a certain condition is met, you use the double equals, exclamation equals, greater than, less than, greater than or equals to, or less than or equals to.

Alternatively, you can also use the "is" keyword or "is not" keyword to check logical equivalence, although this is usually only reserved for checking if a value is "None".

In addition, you can also construct conditional statements by using "or" or "and" keywords to check if at least one condition or multiple conditions are met before executing a block of code.

### Syntax

```python
# Basic syntax of if statement:
if 1 == 1:
    print(True)

if 2 != 1:
    print(True)

if 3 > 2:
    print(True)

if 2 < 3:
    print(True)

if 4 >= 3:
    print(True)

if 3 <= 4:
    print(True)

if None is None:
    print(True)

if 2 is not None:
    print(True)

if 2 == 2 or 2 == 3:
    
    # This line will execute since at least one condition is met
    print(True)

if 3 == 3 and 4 == 4:
    
    # This line will execute since both conditions are met
    print(True)
```

### Example

```python
age = 21

# Basic if statement
# Check if the 'age' variable is greater than or equal to 21
if age >= 21:

    # This line will execute since the condition is met
    print("Do you want a glass of wine with your meal?")

#################################################

animal = "cat"

if animal == "dog":
    
    # This line WON'T execute since the condition is not met
    print("Do you wanna go for a walk outside?!")
```

### The 'elif' statement

### Syntax

```python
# Basic syntax of elif statement:

# Basic syntax of if statement:
if 1 == 1:
    print(True)

if 2 != 1:
    print(True)

if 3 > 2:
    print(True)

if 2 < 3:
    print(True)

if 4 >= 3:
    print(True)

if 3 <= 4:
    print(True)

if None is None:
    print(True)

if 2 is not None:
    print(True)

if 2 == 2 or 2 == 3:
    
    # This line will execute since at least one condition is met
    print(True)

if 3 == 3 and 4 == 4:
    
    # This line will execute since both conditions are met
    print(True)
```

```python

age = 25

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a teenager.")
elif age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
