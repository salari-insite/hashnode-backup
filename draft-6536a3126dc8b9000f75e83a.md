# Introduction

## Definition of control flow

Control flow is the order in which a program's instructions are executed and is determined by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

It allows a program to make decisions, repeat specific tasks, and organize code into reusable functions, enabling complex algorithms and dynamic behavior.

Without control flow, a program would just be a long laundry list of predefined instructions.

Although, control flow allows your program to be able to handle user inputs/behavior, and be able to pivot the outputs/behavior of the program based on the user inputs/behavior.

## Overview of control flow in Python

In Python, control flow mainly consists of conditional statements (if, elif, and else), conditional/unconditional loops (for and while loops), and loop control statements (break, continue, and pass).

Another popular control flow method in other programming languages is switch/case statements. Up until very recently, Python didn't have the capability for switch/case statements. However, with the release of Python 3.10 in 2021, switch/case statements are now supported in Python.

I won't be covering switch/case statements in this article since they're still very new in the Python language, and they're not as widely used as the control flow methods I'll be covering.

Further, the logic of switch/case statements is very similar to if/elif/else statements. Traditionally, switch/case statements are used instead of if/elif/else statements if there are many different conditions/cases that the program has to handle.

Although, for general control flow, switch/case statements aren't always necessary.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in Python are structured as a hierarchy of statements where the first statement is made with the "if" keyword. It should be noted that it is sufficient enough to *just* have an "if" statement. Although, you can also add another conditional statement starting with the "else" keyword after the "if" statement. Finally, if you need to control other conditions in your program, then you can do so with conditional statements placed in between the "if" and "else" statements and made with the "elif" keyword.

The logic behind conditional statements is:

1. If this condition is met/if this is a true statement: do this...
    
2. Elif this condition is met/if this is a true statement: do this...
    
3. Else: do this...
    

The if statement checks a condition, and if it's True, the code block within it is executed. The elif statement checks another condition if the previous conditions are not met. The else statement executes a code block if **none** of the previous conditions are met.

### The 'if' statement

The if statement begins with the "if" keyword, followed by a statement that returns a Boolean value (True or False).

As such, when you're checking if a certain condition is met, you use the double equals, exclamation equals, greater than, less than, greater than or equals to, or less than or equals to.

Alternatively, you can also use the "is" keyword or "is not" keyword to check logical equivalence, although this is only reserved for comparing Boolean values and the None value.

In addition, you can also construct conditional statements by using "or" or "and" keywords to check if at least one condition or multiple conditions are met before executing a block of code.

### Syntax

```python
# Basic syntax of if statement:
if 1 == 1: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if 2 != 1: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if 3 > 2: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if 2 < 3: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if 4 >= 3: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if 3 <= 4: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if None is None: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if False is not None: # True statement
    print(True)

##############################

if 2 == 2 or 2 == 3: # True statement 
    # This line will execute since at least one condition is met
    print(True)

##############################

if 3 == 3 and 4 == 4: # True statement
    # This line will execute since both conditions are met
    print(True)
```

### Example

```python
age = 21

# Basic if statement
# Check if the 'age' variable is greater than or equal to 21
if age >= 21:
    # This line will execute since the condition is met
    print("Do you want a glass of wine with your meal?")

##############################

animal = "cat"

if animal == "dog":
    # This line WON'T execute since the condition is not met
    print("Do you wanna go for a walk outside?!")
```

### The 'elif' statement

Elif statements are placed in between the if statement and the optional else statement.

In one if/elif/else control flow structure, there can be multiple elif statements, but only 1 if statement and 1 else statement.

Similar to the if statement, the elif statement evaluates a comparison or multiple comparisons.

If the original condition in the if statement is not met, then the program will skip to the proceeding elif statement to see if that condition is met.

It's important to note that an if/elif/else control flow structure stops evaluating statements as soon as a condition is met. This means that even if you have multiple elif statements that evaluate to true, only the first elif statement that evaluates to true will be the block of code that is executed.

Also, since each conditional control flow structure has to start with an if statement, this means that the program knows when a new control flow structure you write another if statement line (even if that if statement line is written after another if statement or an elif statement in another control flow structure above it).

### Syntax

```python
# Basic syntax of elif statement:

if 2 == 1: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("2 is equal to 1")

elif 2 != 1: # True statement
    # This line will execute
    print("2 is not equal to 1")

elif 2 > 1: # True statement
    # This statement evaluates to true
    # But, this line won't execute since the elif above 
    # evaluated to true
    print("2 is greater than 1")

##############################

if 2 < 3: # True statement
    # This line will execute
    # Therefore the program won't even evaluate the elif
    # statements below.
    print("2 is less than 3")

elif 4 >= 5: # False statement
    print("4 is greater than or equal to 5")

elif 3 <= 4: # True statement
    print("3 is less than or equal to 4")

##############################

if False is None: # False statement
    # This line won't execute.
    # So, the program will evaluate the proceeding
    # elif statement.
    print("False is None")

elif True is not None: # True statement
    # This line will execute, so the program will 
    # not evaluate the elif statements below.
    print("True is not None")

elif 2 == 2 or 2 == 3: # True statement
    print("2 is equal to 2, or 2 is equal to 3")

elif 3 == 3 and 4 == 4: # True statement
    print(True)
```

### Example

```python
age = 10

if age >= 21: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("Do you want a glass of wine with your meal?")

elif age < 12: # True statement
    # This line will execute
    print("Would you like a kids menu?")

##############################

animal = "dog"

if animal == "dog": # True statement
    # This line will execute.
    # Program won't evaluate the elif statement below.
    print("Do you wanna go for a walk outside?!")

elif animal == "cat": # False statement
    print("Do you want some catnip?!")
```

### The 'else' statement

Similar to the elif statement, the else statement is an optional statement that is placed at the very end of an if/elif/else control flow structure.

Unlike the if and elif statements, the else statement doesn't evaluate if a condition is met. Instead, the program will simply execute the code in the else block if all of the conditions above the else statement are not met.

### Syntax

```python
# Basic syntax of elif statement:

if 2 == 1: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("2 is equal to 1")

else:
    # This line will execute, since the above condition wasn't met
    print("2 is not equal to 1")

##############################

if 2 != 1: # True statement
    # This line will execute
    print("2 is not equal to 1")

elif 2 > 1: # True statement
    print("2 is greater than 1")

else:
    print("2 is equal to 1")

##############################

if 5 < 3: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("5 is less than 3")

elif 4 >= 5: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("4 is greater than or equal to 5")

elif 5 <= 4: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("5 is less than or equal to 4")

else:
    # The program will execute these lines, since
    # the above if/elif conditions were not met.
    print("5 is not less than 3")
    print("4 is not greater than or equal to 5")
    print("5 is not less than or equal to 4")
```

### Examples

```python
age = 18

if age >= 65: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("Would you like a senior discount?")

elif age < 12: # False statement
    # This line won't execute
    print("Would you like a kids menu?")

else:
    # This line will execute, since the above conditions
    # were not met.
    print("Do you have a student ID for a student discount?")

##############################

animal = "fish"

if animal == "fish": # True statement
    # This line will execute.
    print("Check if aquarium needs fresh water")

else:
    print("Check if their water bowl needs more water")
```
